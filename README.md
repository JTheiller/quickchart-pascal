# quickchart-pascal

A pascal client for the QuickChart.io chart API using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and (Functional Programming) In Delphi.

[QuickChart](https://quickchart.io/) is a service that generates images of charts from a URL.  Because these charts are simple images, they are very easy to embed in non-dynamic environments such as email, SMS, chat rooms, and so on.

## 📝 Doc API
